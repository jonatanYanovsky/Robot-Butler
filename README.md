# Robot-Butler
WINLAB summer internship project: Make a robot autonomously find, grab, and return a cup of coffee

Update: We will be using a drone to pick up the cup of coffee and place it on our p3dx robot.

Notes to group:

When updating cpp files, upload them to cpp-modified branch so we can do version control.
